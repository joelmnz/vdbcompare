Our Clients are always wanting to update/expand their existing software to suit their changing business needs & I had to keep track of every structure change & remember to write this into an UpgradeDatabase() function when releasing a new version.

To save me some time I wrote a tool to assist in this process, vdbCompare.

Please see [Developer Requirements](DeveloperRequirements.md) if you wish to contribute to this project.
